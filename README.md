WCCI/GECCO 2020 Competition Evolutionary Computation in Uncertain Environments: A Smart Grid Application 
The algorithm ranked 5th out of 12 candidates.

Two testbeds: 
1) optimization of a centralized day-ahead energy resource management problem in smart grids under environments with uncertainty. This test bed is similar to the past challenge using a challenging 500-scenario case study with high degree of uncertainty. We also add some restrictions to the initialization of initial solution and the allowed repairs and tweak-heuristics. Testbed 

2) bi-level optimization of end-usersâ€™ bidding strategies in local energy markets (LM). This test bed is constructed under the same framework of the past competitions (therefore, former competitors can adapt their algorithms to this new testbed) , representing a complex bi-level problem in which competitive agents in the upper-level try to maximize their profits, modifying and depending on the price determined in the lower-level problem (i.e., the clearing price in the LM), thus resulting in a strong interdependence of their decisions.
